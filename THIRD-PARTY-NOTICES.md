## Protocol references (not distributed)

I learned the BLE pairing and camera Wi-Fi connection path from the public
[Osmosis](https://github.com/KonradIT/osmosis) project by Konrad Iturbe, and I'm grateful. No
Osmosis source is included in or distributed with OpenPocketCine. Live view, monitoring, and the
native shells are our own work.

No DJI SDK or proprietary DJI documentation is included in, distributed with, or required by this
project (see [NOTICE](NOTICE), the
[protocol handbook](https://openpocketcine.app/docs/), and
[`docs/protocol-notes.md`](docs/protocol-notes.md)).

## Lucide HUD icons

- **Homepage:** <https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide>
- **Used for:** HUD and chrome glyphs on iOS and Android (`OpcIcon`). Vendored SVGs live in
  `ios/OpenPocketCine/Resources/Icons/lucide/` and
  `Apps/Android/app/src/main/assets/icons/lucide/`; Android also ships VectorDrawables under
  `Apps/Android/app/src/main/res/drawable/opc_lucide_*.xml`.
- **License:** ISC (full text in those `LICENSE.txt` files). Some glyphs in this set are derived
  from [Feather](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) and are additionally MIT
  (`aperture`, `check`, `chevron-down`, `chevron-left`, `chevron-right`, `chevron-up`, `circle`,
  `circle-plus`, `crosshair`, `download`, `ellipsis`, `info`, `lock`, `maximize`, `minimize`,
  `plus`, `radio`, `share`, `smartphone`, `square`, `trash`, `upload`, `x`, `zoom-in`).
