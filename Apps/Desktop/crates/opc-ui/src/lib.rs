//! Viewfinder chrome.

//! The HUD is rasterised on the CPU into a plain RGBA image that the renderer
//! composites over the picture. That is what makes the chrome testable: every label,
//! lamp and box can be asserted pixel by pixel without a window, a GPU or a camera.
//!
//! Swapping this for a real UI toolkit later means replacing one producer of that
//! image, not unpicking the render pipeline.
