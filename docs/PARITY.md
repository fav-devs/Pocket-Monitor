# Operator parity

iOS is the operator-proven baseline. Android matches operator-visible behavior
unless a row lists an exception. GPU backends, Bluetooth stacks, and OS APIs may
diverge. Shipping a one-platform operator-visible change without a row here is
incomplete.

The desktop shell ([`DESKTOP.md`](DESKTOP.md)) is a **watcher only** and is not an
operator-visible parity peer yet. It has its own row below; until it can run a camera
it does not gate changes to the iOS and Android columns.

Before changing an operator-visible surface, read this file. Ship both shells or
write the exception in the table in the same PR.

| Surface | Must match | May diverge | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Connection FTUE and spine | BLE → SoftAP → UDP; **enable-once**; ephemeral local port; arm `0x02` on handshake ack (Mimo HEVC at join+17 ms; enable is later PLI); disconnect drops driver + decoder; session recovery holds last frame. Pocket 3 first picture: wait for the legal FORMAT table, one 1080→boot `0x02/0x18` after a black enable, then one `0x09/0xa8`. Not Pocket 4. Xtra rebrands bind UDP **10004** with no TCP-7001 poke. Join Wi-Fi names VPNs / ad blockers on both shells; WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW repeats `LocalVPNFilter.liveHint` after 8 s with no picture when a local VPN is on. | iOS `NEHotspotConfiguration` vs Android `WifiNetworkSpecifier` + `bindProcessToNetwork`; Network.framework vs Android sockets. Android identifies Xtra by BLE MAC OUI `EC:9E:EA`; iOS has no MAC and uses the advertised name (`xtra` / `edge`). Android SoftAP `onLost` starts `SessionRecovery`; iOS does not (keepalive must not `discardUDP` while the path is gone). Android VPN detect is `TRANSPORT_VPN`; iOS is CFNetwork scoped tunnel names (also fires for Private Relay `utun` — live hint still waits 8 s). | **physical** both |
| Live chrome | DISP 1/2 maps, layout metrics (`LiveDesign` / `fillCrop` / screen-flip pillarbox), picker chrome, record as bottom sheet, zoom chip, gimbal 1–5 gain, expo stick throw (on-screen and a connected game controller), stick pan picture-relative (invert pan on rotate-180 at settle, not joystick 180; extra-mirror = TT180 && Selfie Flip off; MIRROR assist XORs), rec lamp `pressShutter`. Game controller (discussion #159): left stick is the gimbal stick; Cross/A records (skips the rec-confirmation sheet); Circle/B recenters; Square/X is rotate-180; Triangle/Y tracks a face in frame or cancels; L1/R1 jump zoom out/in (out does not wrap to tele); L2/R2 hold-to-zoom (deeper trigger is faster); D-pad up/down ISO, left/right shutter. Toast Gamepad connected/disconnected. Unplug rests stick and zoom. Controls **Gamepad** row is Connected / Not connected. Limit haptic is a rising-edge pulse after the head moves then stalls (phone plus controller rumble). Mapping, extra deadzone slider, and Linear/Smooth/Cinematic curves are not a Controls picker (fixed map; existing 0.08 deadzone + expo + 1–5 gain). iPad hides the system time / battery bar (HUD chips stay). Control toast parks under the mounted top bar (DISP 1 / operator-shown status bar) and on the feed edge when that bar is off (DISP 2). | iOS Liquid Glass vs Kyant (API 33+ and ≥4 GB; else solid frost); SF Symbols / Material only where Lucide catalog has not replaced them. Android edge-to-edge keeps a transparent system bar. DualSense rumble uses `GCDeviceHaptics` on iOS and the pad `Vibrator` on Android (phone vibrator if the pad has none). iOS binds `GCController`; Android `KeyEvent`/`MotionEvent` plus `InputManager` for connect. Both shells GET Selfie Flip pid `0x0038` ~1 Hz on the live UDP ACK pump (untracked; not the shared `0x8E` SET/GET waiter) and echo pktType-`0x03` seq in window-ACK group 1 so those replies do not stall. A keepalive BLE Flip GET fires when UDP replies go stale (≥2 s). | **physical** both |
| Assists | Toolbar 1:1 (LUT, PEAK, FALSE, ZEBRA, WAVE, PARADE, HISTO, VECTOR, LIGHTS, ND, AUDIO, GUIDES, GRID, CROSS, MIRROR); long-press options; WAVE hold-without-drag opens options; scope plate metrics (`ScopeMiniChrome`); ND is a small HUD chip that parks bottom-leading above the view-assist toolbar, hold-drag movable like other scope panels; long-press Units switches Stops / ND32 / ND 0.3 (suggestion only, not a SET); number fields in those options (Zebra Highlight / Midtone) lift above the keyboard; number-pad Done dismisses the pad (tap outside still dismisses the popup) | Metal vs Vulkan vs GLES; Vision vs ML Kit Face Detection; PixelCopy / Kyant sampling | **physical** both |
| Camera SETs | `CameraSetMailbox` fire-and-forget + 300 ms retransmit + 2 s settle; missed ACK does not revert HUD. FORMAT pin holds the chip/sheet until `cam_video_param_v2` reports the pair — other HUD copies are not confirmation. WB `0x02/0x2C` Auto keeps tint (`00 00 00 <tint i16>`); Custom is kelvin+tint; one in flight (100 ms coalesce). COLOR drum follows the body (D-Log2 is Pocket 4 Pro only; Pocket 4 Normal/HDR/D-Log; Pocket 3 Normal/HDR/D-Log M; Nano 8-bit/10-bit/D-Log M). Auto ISO range floor is 50 on Pocket 3 / Pocket 4 and 100 on Pocket 4 Pro (wide); SET bytes unchanged. ISO D-Log ↔ D-Log2 hop; audio blobs and tap-focus stay round-trips. Two genuine SET timeouts in 5 s may rebuild UDP only when video **and** status are stale (encoder-pause with young `0x01` must not tear the socket). | JNI vs Swift `fireCamera` | **physical** both |
| Zoom | Chip follows the body (DJI spec): Pocket 4 Pro 1×→3×→6×→12×; Pocket 4 / 3 1×→2×→4× (Pocket 3 4K Video max 2×); Nano 1×. SlowMo / TimeLapse / SuperNight drop digital zoom (Pro keeps 1×/3× optical). `CamFov` hybrid readout; pinch clamps to that max at 20 Hz without ACK wait. Idle D-Log2 hops to D-Log on the first step off 1× (`0x02/0x42`) and **holds every `0xB8` until `cam_image_effect` is D-Log** — color ACK and an optimistic HUD pin are not enough; the body ignores zoom while still D-Log2. The chip stays at live 1× until that hop lands. While rolling in D-Log2 the chip is gray (0.4, same as lock) but still hittable: tap and pinch toast `Can't change color while recording — D-Log2 can't zoom` and send neither zoom nor color. D-Log / Rec.709 / HLG still zoom while rolling. Chip / pinch must not drop the live picture (same-raster VPS is not an IDR hold; 4 s watchdog grace while the lens slews). | Hit-testing over SurfaceView vs SwiftUI | **physical** both |
| Tracking | Long-press+drag search box `0x02/0xA6`; tap face bracket → ActiveTrack; green cancel X and focus-reset. Gamepad Triangle/Y tracks the AF-C face in frame, or cancels if already tracking. | Vision vs ML Kit Face Detection | **physical** both |
| Motion Control speed | No operator rate calibration. No artificial speed ceiling; duration controls retain a 0.5 s floor. Native maximum repeatable speed is not yet qualified. | Both shells | **physical** both |
| Head tracking | iOS: Controls **Head Tracking (Experimental)**, off by default. **Calibrate Head Lock** captures shared forward from a still head and fresh native camera pose. Nose direction maps to native pan/tilt targets; the native command horizon is 100 ms. Roll is readout only. STOP clears Head Lock. Manual control, Motion Control takes and inactive scenes take priority. Stale measurements and callbacks cannot keep driving. | Android has no AirPods IMU — no Controls row. Native head response remains under physical qualification; [contract](head-tracking.md). | **physical** iOS |
| Watch companion | Apple Watch: live preview, timecode, storage, camera battery, rec/shutter. Phone is the radio. Rec on the wrist skips Record Confirmation (same as gamepad Cross/A). | iOS only. Wear OS later. No complication, no phone battery on the wrist, no Digital Crown gimbal. | **physical** iOS + Watch |
| Operator Setup | Seven tabs (Link, Sharing, View Assist, Controls, Display, Storage, System); DJI Black; Sora + IBM Plex; NOTICE legal | Frame.io row is “Not configured” until iOS keys exist. Sharing browse / advertise / join / control is **iOS-only** (Bonjour `_opc-mon._tcp` on the same camera Wi-Fi, no peer-to-peer discovery or streaming; host Wi-Fi QR join code). iOS uses bounded encode admission and independent per-watcher video windows ([relay performance](watcher-relay.md)). iOS watcher now reuses local monitor assists/scopes, telemetry, REC tally, fitted focus, token-gated camera controls, and bounded reconnect. Android Sharing stays Coming soon until its relay, monitor, and join flow are implemented. | **physical** iOS for Sharing; both for the other six tabs |
| Desktop monitor | Direct Windows BLE pairing, manual SoftAP join, UDP live session, content-driven AVC/HEVC decode, Vulkan presentation, fitted tracking, typed recording/zoom/gimbal commands and a Slint-rendered DJI Mimo operator HUD (Outfit type, Tabler icons): top bar (menu, gimbal follow, format, exposure mode, exit), zoom ruler, exposure and status plates parked in the letterbox gutters, joystick, record, CTR / FOLLOW / STILL / fullscreen, and a Mimo mode strip with Pano and Livestream greyed. Every button carries its key hint. Link/REC state and the readouts leave the image centre clear. The feed, decoder and renderer remain independent of the shell through `Link`. | **Exception: desktop is a direct paired monitor, not a mobile-equivalent shell yet.** Pass 1 primary pointer/touch controls and the Mimo chrome are implemented. The mode strip, fullscreen button and gimbal FOLLOW cycle are desktop-only surfaces (mobile has no mode picker and hides follow mode in the gimbal sheet). The format, exposure and settings sheets carry the typed commands (format, expo mode, ISO, ISO max, shutter, EV, focus, white balance, colour, FOV, gimbal mode and speed, audio channel, vocal boost) plus the desktop assists (grid, zebra, peaking, LUT, mirror, timecode). The phones' fifteen-tool assist toolbar is under the top bar (`A`): false colour from the core's own lattices with a reference key, peaking sensitivity and colour, zebra highlight / midtone levels and colours on the feed's axis per colour mode, thirds / phi / diagonal grid, Film and Social guide frames with a mask, and the crosshair; the scopes (waveform, parade, histogram, vectorscope, traffic lights, ND chip, audio meters) are movable plates sampled from the decoded picture on the CPU and plotted on the core's `ScopeDisplayScale` axis. Wind noise reduction and directional audio read the DSP blob and send it back patched, as the phones do. The library lists the card through the facade (the core decodes every page), fetches thumbnails, proxies and originals over `/v2` into the phones' cache layout, stars and deletes with the core's vouched handles, and plays the 720p proxy through the feed pipeline with the assists on it; the Pocket 3 `0x01/0x01` playback entry and the single-card storage rule are honoured. The grid has the phones' select mode with a batch delete and folds bursts under their first frame (Expand / Fold); the player's conform chip cycles the core's `ConformPreview` targets at its speed ratio, and Auto LUT reads the original's `moov` tail through `ClipColorProfile` for the official cube the operator dropped in the LUT folder. LUT import is a drop folder listed by the core's `CustomLUTIndex` rules rather than a file picker; the gimbal ramp is the phones' filter on both the keys and the pad; the take countdown length is a setting the phones do not have. No delivery / export, no Frame.io, no scopes over playback, and programmed moves run exact A→B→C legs on native timed targets with the approach, hold, sub-move split, missing-sector guard, the phones' smoothness fillet at B and pause / resume, but without the fitted-delay B check. Orientation is drawn but opens nothing; the setup tabs (Link, Controls with a game controller on the phones' map, Display, Storage, System) are in and the operator's settings persist. Desktop-only: the System tab's virtual camera puts the graded picture into the platform's own camera — a `v4l2loopback` device on Linux, a Media Foundation virtual camera (`opc_vcam_win.dll`, registered once) on Windows 11, the OpenPocketCine camera extension on macOS — or into a loopback MJPEG stream for OBS anywhere; the Windows and macOS cameras are type-checked or written to the platform pattern but not yet run on their machines. A click on the picture is Mimo's tap-to-focus burst with a reticle; a drag is a tracking box polled on the phones' cadence until the body locks or lets go; the Camera tab carries the focus-track mode (Default / Product Showcase / Subject Lock / Registered Priority). The AF-C face bracket needs an on-device detector the desktop does not have. Live-control SETs go through the core's `CameraSetMailbox` (latest wins per opcode, 300 ms retransmit, 2 s settle, late ACKs accepted) with the FORMAT pin; the zoom ruler carries the body's own stops from `activeZoomStops` and the D-Log2 hop. The desktop preserves mobile command semantics and all camera writes stay on the ACK worker, but physical Pocket qualification is still required. | `build-swift-core.bat` builds and stages the Windows executable; shell/UI tests cover hit priority, gimbal release/cancel rest, record behavior, resize layout and recovery truth. **Physical** direct-camera verification remains required for record/stop, zoom, gimbal release, touch tracking, resize, long-run feed stability and bottom-edge integrity. |
| Media | Camera catalog, SoftAP HTTP cache, 720p LRF/XRF proxy playback, independent playback assist rail, LUT / PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA grade that proxy (identity player + overlay/replace feed), live HEVC held while library or Operator Setup covers the monitor (do not drop pktType `0x02` ingest — #177; Android keeps the SurfaceView attached under that overlay — #248). Next/prev keeps the processed-feed host so an armed LUT rebakes the new item without cycling the chip. Shot color lives in the media cache (`color.json`) so Auto LUT works disconnected. **Proxy** tag when only the 720p sidecar is on the phone. Storage **Full Resolution Caching** (on by default) also caches the original on open. Playback LUT replace hides the identity player once the GPU owns the cube (live already does). Pocket 3 `/v2` is always storage 0 (single microSD), even when the list handle has the internal bit. Newest catalog page lists even if `0x02/0x0c` ACKs E0 after a take; older pages still need playback. | Frame.io upload and LUT bake on export: iOS only. iOS Share **Bake LUT** has **Bake exposure** (on by default) so the LUT exposure pull is written into the file; off keeps the cube at 0.0. iOS Share **Convert log** (off by default) is a technical D-Log ↔ D-Log2 transform, exclusive with Bake LUT; Rec.709 display stays Bake LUT. Android share/save uses the original (`MediaHTTP.deliveryPath`). Playback chrome is an 82% DJI-black plate (no Kyant). GPU backends: iOS `CIFeedView` vs Android GLES. iOS playback stacks `AVPlayerLayer` and `CIFeedView` as siblings — Metal nested in `AVPlayerLayer` is a black LUT plate. Android playback already matches live: ExoPlayer writes an OES surface and `LiveFeedEffectsSession` grades LUT/FALSE/PEAK/ZEBRA in GLES (`PlaybackFeedView`); TextureView is only the window. | **physical** both |
| Present path | `FeedPresentPolicy`: skip duplicate timestamps, latest-wins bake, freeze ≠ flush (2 s keep last sample), unhide replace-grade before the drawable, offscreen `isEnabled = false`, one `0x09/0xa8` in flight (`SerialSessionGate`), one Metal/GLES present in flight (`maxInFlightMetalPresents`). LUT 50/50 is a cube option, not a decoder/swapchain tear — split without a cube must not cover identity. LUT cubes at the 720p feed raster then stretches Rec.709 (`bakeSize` then bilinear). | iOS Metal / `CIFeedView` vs Android Vulkan / GLES `LiveFeedEffectsSession`; debug line is `control-live.log` / logcat, not operator chrome. Extra-mirror commits on the feed host at present (TT180) after holding the last picture 3 frames / 120 ms so the current orientation is not X-flipped in place. iOS `CAMetalLayer.allowsNextDrawableTimeout` (no MainActor block). Android already gates GPU split on a loaded cube. | **physical** both |
| Diagnostics | Operator Setup → System **and** Connection setup (first pair) → **Share Diagnostics** (redacted report). Journal in app documents. No analytics upload. | iOS copies a compact paste on screenshot for TestFlight feedback (Apple cannot attach files to that form). Android has no TestFlight screenshot hook — Share only. MetricKit is iOS. | **physical** both |
| Multiview prototype | Experimental shared Wi-Fi with independent per-camera BLE provisioning, bounded identity-verified LAN discovery, normal UDP preview, per-camera and group recording with fresh status confirmation. | iOS only; Android deferred. Pocket 3/4/4 Pro and Nano have preview profiles. Action/360 and unprofiled Osmo can attempt network-only setup. Audio, phone hotspot, unprofiled models and four-camera thermal behavior remain unverified. | Physical iPhone: Pocket 4 Pro, Pocket 3 and Nano preview together, automatic discovery, all three record starts/stops and tally borders confirmed. Dedicated parallel-setup, saved-stage restoration and AP-return checks remain pending. |
| Multiview stage polish | Camera-list grid icon, adaptive grid/Center stage, floating names, settings/timecode, per-camera Auto LUT, Live View record lamp, compact Layout/Wi-Fi/Fit/Fill bar, centered network setup and Add picker, device-only credentials, bounded recovery and borrowed Live View. | iOS experimental only; Android deferred. Borrowed Live View disables Sharing; the relay lifecycle and watcher controls remain single-camera only. Returning to the stage cancels programmed motion and head tracking. Hotspot status is interface detection, not a reliable Settings-switch flag. No frame-accurate synchronization. | Physical iPhone: setup navigation, scan cancellation, all Add buttons, password bounds, touch targets, three-camera portrait/landscape Fit/Fill and tally checks pass. All three feeds resumed after app switching; Pocket 3 took roughly a minute. Borrowed full controls, hotspot transitions and repeated Wi-Fi joins still need physical verification. |
| Nano transport assembly | Shared length-based assembly across transport groups and length-aware private AVC metadata parsing. | Both shells use shared assembly. Android passes raw access units to MediaCodec, so applying the private metadata filter to its decoder input and physical regression remain pending. | iPhone captured-stream replay: 359/359 decoded, zero errors. Nano normal monitor physically confirmed smooth by the operator; live counters matched ~25 fps with no missing decoded pictures. Android and Pocket regression pending. |
| Nano frame-queue protection | Preserve AVC parameter sets and IDR when trimming a live frame backlog. | iOS queue uses a latched codec; Android has a different buffering path. The iOS regression fix is not yet physically verified as a stutter fix. | iOS synthetic overload regression plus physical cadence comparison pending |
| Explicit skip | — | VideoToolbox, MetalFX super-res, iOS 26 Liquid Glass API, Frame.io OAuth, LEVEL / De-SQ / MAG | n/a |

Datalink bind, ACK, enable-write, and decoder latch facts live in

## Chrome metrics

Must match across shells. Do not keep a second copy in `ANDROID.md`.

- View Assist options and capture pickers: 27 dp close, 12 dp pad, 8 dp gap.
- Drum faces 27/20 pt with 0.12/0.88 fade. ISO / shutter / WB drums fill so
  neighbours peek; short menus hug.
- FORMAT and COLOR hang 8 dp under the top-deck chips at 340 dp
  (`LiveTopPickerHost`) and hug — they do not fill to the assist bar.
- LUT 50/50 stays pinned. LUT exposure stepper is −3…+3 at ½ stop,
  input-referred before the cube (ETTR pull). Not camera EV. Playback Auto
  uses clip Keys `com.dji.camera.ColorGammaSxS` on the **original** take
  (D-Log / D-Log2 / Rec.709 / Rec.2100 HLG). LRF/XRF proxies are Rec.709
  even for log — do not read them. A 2 MiB Range of the original tail is
  enough when the 4K file is not cached. Last live log is the fallback when
  the atom is missing. Opening LUT in playback does not restamp Auto from the
  live SET — including disconnected library clips (no camera `inPlayback`
  flag). `nclx` stays Rec.709 for log.
  iOS Share Bake LUT nests Bake exposure (on by default). Share **Convert
  log** is exclusive with Bake LUT (off by default; D-Log ↔ D-Log2 only).
  Share card hugs; max height 520 dp so portrait Back stays off the status bar.
- Picker / assist cards add a 0.20 black ND on HUD glass.
- `ScopeMiniChrome`: 0.72 rounded plate, hairline, 16 dp corner, 16 dp shadow.
- Movable scope panel: 0.3 s hold then drag, L-corner 2 dp outside the clip,
  scale 0.6…1.6.
- Histogram gutters 17.5 dp (traffic lamps + 0 / 100), not 17.5 px.
- Zebra stored thresholds stay 0–100 IRE; 0–255 readout is encoded codes via
  `ScopeDisplayScale.signalNative`.
- CineStop (formerly PStops) is Video Mode IRE on the WAVE axis: sparse
  0–4 / 5 / 10–12 / 41–48 / 61–70 / 92–100 stripes over grayscale. Rec.709
  18% hits 41–48 green; D-Log2 18% is a gap. Saved PStops / ZC Stops still
  load as CineStop.
- IRE is six video-level WAVE zones over grayscale: BDL (0–2.5 purple),
  NBDL (2.5–10 blue), 18%MG (38–42 green), MG+1 (52–56 pink), 80%WC
  (80–95 yellow), 95%WC (95–100 red). Rec.709 18% hits 18%MG; D-Log2
  18% is a gap. 95%WC is live-tap ceiling red.
- EL Zone is scene-EV: 15 contiguous bands around 18% gray; +6 and above
  white, −6 and below black. The reference ruler is −6/−3/18%/+3/+6, not
  stretched to live-tap clip.
- FALSE Scale is CineStop / EL Zone / IRE / Limits.
- Gimbal cluster: stick + zoom chip + gimbal-controls button as one
  trailing-bottom parking spot in every orientation. Zoom stacks above the
  stick. The gimbal button is a zoom-sized circle leading of zoom, trailing
  as a pair — not glued to record. On width-constrained iPad, record sits
  on the canvas floor: the cluster stays on the right edge and lifts above
  the record button. The stick does not move when the button appears.
  Nano hides stick, button, and the gimbal sheet (`hasGimbal`).
  The gimbal sheet parks like a capture picker: slide-up HUD glass, 10 dp
  above the capture/assist bar, centred on the gimbal chip, 340 cap.
  Motion Control editor is 340 dp wide and moves by holding anywhere (0.3 s); the minimized pill
  drags immediately after touch slop and suppresses its buttons during the drag.
  Duration dials are 180 × 44 dp, with moving ticks, a fixed index, and a
  spring settle. They swipe horizontally in 0.5 s steps (12 dp per step), with
  adjustable accessibility actions. Start shows a cancellable 3–2–1 countdown
  before automatic preparation and approach; the settle at A remains separate.
  Update uses a refresh icon. C stays hidden until B is set. There is no drag handle.
  C enables Smoothness: nonzero values round B with a timed Bézier fillet
  and show a subtle dashed preview. Smoothed takes use bounded 20 Hz native
  look-ahead commands; A/C remain exact and B is intentionally bypassed.
  Marker-only measured-velocity prediction is capped at 100 ms.
  Waypoint letters paint under the floating card as directions on the
  gimbal unit sphere, projected through live `0x04/0x05` (look-up is
  above center). Run needs A and B. Both shells
  use camera-timed legs, preserve chosen durations, settle 2 s at A,
  and add no hold between A→B and B→C. Missed deadlines or stale feedback
  stop the take with an operator message. Final position is checked after
  feedback catches up. The editor omits qualification and debug copy; qualification status remains documented below.
  Yaw unwraps onto −48…225 (raw −135 at the positive endpoint); tilt
  targets stay within −44…70. Measurements are never clipped into fake
  endpoints; capture and native dispatch reject out-of-range targets. Full contract and pending
  physical qualification: [Motion Control takes](programmed-moves.md).
  Run preps Fast + tilt unlocked. No zoom SET during the slew. No motion debug plate is displayed.

## Native motion qualification

Native Motion Control takes remain experimental on both shells. Three short iOS
Pocket 4 Pro A→B→C runs passed; broader repeatability, Pocket 3/4 firmware and
physical Android qualification remain outstanding. The iOS-only native AirPods
path is implemented with the existing no-Android-IMU exception, but rapid
retargeting and wearer response are not yet physically qualified. See
[Motion Control takes](programmed-moves.md) and [head tracking](head-tracking.md).

Motion Control UX (2026-09-08): physical iPhone checks passed for duration
dial swipes after a hold, dragging from both minimized buttons without
activation, intentional taps, and countdown cancellation. Android implements
the same controls; physical Android verification is pending (no device).

Native rotation safety: approach uses reachable-arc segments, and exact legs
spanning at least 180° use timed native sub-moves along the reachable arc. Last-mile dispatch
rejects ambiguous pan directions from fresh actual feedback. Selfie Flip is a
presentation/stick mapping concern, not a sign change for native waypoints.
MIRROR assist reflects waypoint letters and the dashed preview.

Motion Control continuation uses Start/Pause/Resume/Stop in both shells. Pause
freezes remaining time; Resume requires fresh, settled feedback and has no new
countdown. Duration dials run from 0.5 to 120 seconds (left increases, right
decreases). Android physical qualification remains outstanding.

## Multiview saved stage and shutdown (in validation)

The iOS development shell saves tile assignments, layout, focus, LUT selection,
experimental setup choice and verified identity/address hints in device-only
Keychain storage. Network passwords remain in the separate network Keychain
record. Reopening restores the selected network and starts camera connections
independently, with per-address reservations during LAN identity verification.
The standard single-camera BLE path retains exclusive-camera cleanup.

Closing the stage closes monitoring, then attempts the documented AP switch over
independent BLE links. Failed cleanup remains saved and the operator may close
anyway; the next Multiview entry retries it. Force quit cannot guarantee cleanup.
No record-stop command is sent. Camera AP availability, recording continuity,
concurrent pairing, and restore across app relaunch still require physical proof.
Network scanning records an unassigned camera in the device-only cleanup ledger
before requesting station mode, even before a network is configured. Scan completion
and cancellation attempt AP restoration; failed resets survive closure and relaunch.
Concurrent scan cancellation and stage closure share one reset task per camera.
Automated cancellation/retry/persistence tests pass; physical scan-only AP restoration
still needs verification before release.
Android Multiview remains deferred.

## First-picture random-access gate

The iOS compressed-frame decoder waits for initial AVC IDR / HEVC IRAP submission
before treating inter frames as picture. This prevents a Pocket 3 P-only stream
from settling first-picture recovery. Android has a different presentation path;
its equivalent behavior and physical regression remain to be checked. iOS
regression reproduced false presentation before the fix. Five consecutive
Pocket 3 normal-monitor joins passed on iPhone; broader model regression remains
pending.

AVC now starts in VideoToolbox before the first IDR, avoiding a compressed-layer
to VT handoff that stranded Pocket 3 mid-GOP. HEVC routing is unchanged. Nano
uses the same AVC route: repeated parameter sets and assist toggles preserve the
VT session in regression tests; physical cadence verification is pending. Pocket
3 first picture at approximately 25 fps is physically observed across five
consecutive normal-monitor joins. Android's MediaCodec ownership does not use this iOS
handoff; its physical regression remains pending.

### False-color map continuity (iOS)

The iOS asynchronous CI cube cache now retains coherent paint/mask pairs during
exposure updates and builds from immutable core exposure anchors. Android does
not use this CI cache; its rendering path is unchanged. D-Log M now has a distinct transfer in both shells: scopes use direct signal
percentages, and scene-stop math is explicitly an empirical Pocket 3 estimate.
Calibrated sensor clipping warnings require separate curve/range validation. See `docs/pocket3-dlogm-curve.md`.

Pocket 3/iPhone continuity was physically checked on 2026-09-10: 60 screen samples
across approximately 30 seconds retained the paint with auto ISO active. D-Log M
calibration and other camera-model regression checks remain outstanding.

### Live assist alignment during resize (iOS)

The iOS shell commits video and assist child geometry together during rotation
and portrait fit/fill changes. This fixes independent AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer
animation relative to its Metal overlay; Android does not use that layer pair.
Pocket 3/iPhone physical verification covered eight fit/fill changes and four
rotations with false color, peaking, and zebras active. See `docs/live-session.md`.

### D-Log M signal scopes

Swift and Kotlin preserve the full normalized signal axis for D-Log M without
D-Log black/EI anchors. The iOS scope chip is `DLM ≈`; EL Zone reference is `DLM ≈`
on both shells, with help explaining the Pocket 3 estimate. No implicit D-Log
vectorscope LUT is used. Signal endpoints are not measured sensor limits.
Synthetic all-code/ISO tests cover the mapping. Pocket 3/iPhone was checked on
2026-09-10: active RGB waveform, approximately 25 fps, and a journal confirming
`transfer=dlogm clip=255` at ISO 320. Android camera validation remains pending. See `docs/pocket3-dlogm-curve.md`.

LUT exposure compensation (including baked exports) and Face Priority EV retain
their pre-existing D-Log-based approximation for D-Log M in this scope-only fix.
They are not calibrated D-Log M operations. Changing scopes must not silently
change saved looks, exported images, or automatic camera exposure; correcting
those operations requires separate validation. Scene-stop estimates do not drive them.

### Multiview foreground recovery and reconnect

The iOS decoder checks both decoded-picture age and GPU-present age: repainting
an old LUT image does not establish a recovered camera. A failed foreground decoder repair escalates through the
existing bounded session-rejoin budget. Each failed tile offers one Reconnect
action plus Remove. Reconnect tries saved identity/LAN discovery first, then
camera network setup if needed, preserving the LUT choice. Android Multiview
remains deferred. Pocket 3 LUT-on foreground freeze was reproduced physically;
post-fix physical app-switch testing confirmed all three feeds resumed. Pocket 3
required a full rejoin and took roughly a minute; this is recovery proof, not a
claim of seamless foreground return.

Multiview shows reported camera timecode below each tile name, including compact
side tiles; Nano has no timecode readout. It follows the existing 5 Hz settings
updates. The bottom bar contains Layout, Wi-Fi, and Fit/Fill, with Add camera retained in
the tiles. Enlarged one/two-camera grids put Add in a tile header so adding the
next camera remains available without the bottom-bar shortcut.

### Multiview portrait composition (iOS)

Center stage puts the selected camera above a two-column secondary grid in
portrait, using the stage width instead of shrinking the landscape arrangement.
The portrait main tile stays 16:9 in both Fit and Fill; the choice fits or crops
the image inside it. Fill can expand landscape main tiles and grid cells. The
Close control sits at the upper screen corner, and the shared Fit/Fill control
has a visible FIT/FILL label in the bottom bar in both orientations. The
choice is saved with the stage; older saved stages default to Fit. Viewport size
drives orientation on iPhone and iPad. Tile/decoder identity is retained during
layout changes. Android Multiview remains deferred. Physical iPhone verification
on 2026-09-10 covered a three-camera stage, Fit → Fill → landscape → portrait → Fit,
with the bottom controls visible and the reported timecodes retained. A follow-up
physical iPhone check confirmed the main tile stays 16:9 in both modes, the Close
target is fully on-screen near the upper corner, and FIT/FILL remains visible and
hittable through portrait → landscape → portrait.

Multiview recording tiles reuse Live View's red tally border, inset around each
tile including compact secondary previews. Borders follow per-camera reported
recording state, not a pending Record all request. Empty and stopped tiles have
no tally. Physical iPhone verification on 2026-09-10 confirmed red borders on
Pocket 4 Pro, Pocket 3 and Nano after Record all, and none after Stop all. The
journal confirmed all three starts and all three stops. Android Multiview remains
deferred.

### Pocket 3 FORMAT fallback

Pocket 3 returns a nonzero result for the `camcap_video_format` subscription
while ordinary status subscriptions succeed. In normal Video mode, both shells
therefore use the documented Pocket 3 list when the reported table is empty:
1080p/2.7K/4K landscape, 1080p/2160p/3K square, and 1080p/2.7K/3K vertical, each
at 24/25/30/48/50/60 fps. A reported table always wins. Unknown modes, SlowMo and
livestream retain their existing handling. This is a picker fallback; it does
not rewrite reported camera capabilities. Synthetic picker tests cover model and
mode isolation. On 2026-09-11, physical iPhone build 0.1.0 (99) selected and
recorded landscape 2.7K/25 D-Log M, then retained that format/color after app
relaunch/reconnect. The complete camera original is HEVC Main 10, 2688×1512,
25fps, 157 frames; full decode passed. This qualifies one pair only. Other
pairs, camera power-off persistence and physical Android verification remain
pending. See the [survey evidence](../handbook/src/content/docs/protocol/pocket3.md#openpocketcine-recording-and-warm-reconnect).

### FORMAT retains the reported size while capabilities are unavailable

Both shells keep a reported portrait, square, 2.7K or unknown resolution visible
when the effective format list is empty. For example, a reported `3K 9:16`
shows a `3K` tab, and changing fps keeps its portrait resolution byte. The
legacy 1080/4K tabs remain when no current size has been reported or the size
is already one of those two landscape sizes. Reported capabilities and the
confirmed Pocket 3 normal-Video matrix still take precedence.

Core and Android picker regressions cover this behavior, including retaining the
portrait resolution when changing fps. After installing the correction on an
iPhone 16 Pro Max on 2026-09-11, the operator confirmed that the vertical 3K
picker worked. Physical Android verification and an on-camera fps-change check
remain pending. The operator's earlier session inputs were not captured, so the
reproduction does not establish that this fallback caused that session's behavior.

### Log conversion export (iOS)

Share **Convert log** chooses one **Output curve** (D-Log or D-Log2) for the
whole selection. Already-matching clips are copied or remuxed. Unknown profiles
remain eligible until the original file is read; non-log clips are skipped.
Actual conversion applies the technical cube to encoded values without sRGB
color matching and rewrites the embedded QuickTime shot-color key to the
destination curve while retaining other metadata. Ordinary Bake LUT keeps its
existing display-color path. Android continues to share the original.

Synthetic video export regressions cover pixels, both curve directions, embedded
metadata, and unchanged source files. The original toggle was tried on an iPhone;
the new destination picker and a real camera take through an NLE still need
physical verification.
