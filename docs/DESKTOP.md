# Desktop — a third shell, Windows first

`Apps/Desktop/` is a PC shell for OpenPocketCine. Windows is the target platform;
macOS and Linux come along because nothing in the stack is Windows-specific.

It starts as a **watcher**: a second screen for a feed an iPhone is already hosting.
That ordering is deliberate. A watcher never opens BLE and never joins the camera's
SoftAP on its own, so the first desktop milestone skips the two hardest things to port
and still ships something an operator can use. Direct camera control comes after.

Operator-visible behavior lives in [`PARITY.md`](PARITY.md). The relay contract lives in
[`watcher-relay.md`](watcher-relay.md). This file is the desktop build and I/O notes.

Talking to a camera directly — the laptop as the viewfinder, with gimbal, zoom, record
and tracking — is [`desktop-camera-link.md`](desktop-camera-link.md).

## How the desktop build is structured

1. **Portable Swift core** — `Sources/OpenPocketViewCore/` is already Foundation-only, so
   it compiles for a desktop triple with no changes.
2. **C-ABI facade** — `Sources/OpenPocketCineDesktopFacade/` exports the relay surface
   through `@_cdecl` entry points, the same trick the Android facade uses for JNI.
   `Sources/COpcDesktop/` holds the fixed-layout C records both sides agree on.
3. **Rust host** — `Apps/Desktop/` owns sockets, discovery, decoding, drawing, and the
   command line. Rust is here for one reason: it is the only ecosystem with a single
   Bluetooth API that covers Windows, macOS, and Linux, which is what milestone 3 needs.
4. **One implementation of the protocol.** The host calls the core for framing, kind
   validation, payload limits, join rules, the retry ladder, the delivery-delay guard,
   focus fitting, and every JSON shape. Nothing about the wire format is written twice.

                                                        opc-relay  →  opc-watcher
```

| Crate | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `opc-core-sys` | Raw FFI declarations and the `#[repr(C)]` mirrors of the shared header |
| `opc-relay` | Receive buffer, Bonjour discovery, TCP transport, the join state machine |
| `opc-camera` | Camera commands, DUML transport, and the window-ACK pump |
| `opc-decode` | HEVC and AVC decoding over libavcodec, and Annex-B replay of a dump |
| `opc-render` | The Vulkan feed pipeline, the cube upload, the chrome composite, and PNG stills |
| `opc-ui` | The viewfinder's chrome: a bitmap font, a CPU canvas, the key map, the format ladder, the tracking arithmetic |
| `opc-monitor` | The viewfinder — a window on the camera itself |
| `opc-watcher` | The command-line shell, and a window on a phone's shared feed |

## What the shell owns

Sockets, Bonjour, decoding, GPU, windowing, credential storage, and the command line.
That is the same split the iOS and Android shells follow — see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## The feed pipeline

Up to five passes, in the phones' order:

1. `ycbcr.frag` converts the decoder's planes to RGB **at the source raster**.
2. `peaking_blur.frag` and `peaking_mask.frag` build the edge mask, when peaking is on.
3. `feed.frag` grades through the colour cube and paints zebra and peaking.
4. `blit.frag` stretches the result into a centred rectangle that keeps the picture's
   proportions; the bars around it are the render pass's own clear.
5. `overlay.frag` composites the shell's chrome over that, into an image or a swapchain
   image.

The chrome gets its own pass rather than a branch inside `feed.frag` for one reason: a
HUD that went through the colour cube would tell an operator the wrong thing about
exposure. `opc_render::letterbox` is public because the shell has to map a click back
through exactly the rectangle the blit drew into — one formula, asserted against the
pixels it produces.

Cube at the feed raster, *then* stretch. Cubing after the upsample blotched D-Log2 on
Android ([`../ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md)) and would here too.

Only the first pass is new. Passes 2 and 3 are the feed, blit and peaking programs that
came over from the retired Android shell, now in `crates/opc-render/shaders/`. Android
converted with a `VkSamplerYcbcrConversion` over the decoder's AHardwareBuffer; software
decode hands over three separate planes, so that conversion is written out in
`crates/opc-render/shaders/ycbcr.frag` using the same BT.709 limited-range matrix.

`feed.frag` samples five bindings unconditionally. The ones an operator has turned off
get a 1×1 texture and a zeroed `*On` flag, which keeps the shared shader untouched.
Zebra and peaking are driven; false colour and the scopes are not yet — see the
milestones below.

Peaking sensitivity is transcribed from `PeakingSense` in the Android shell's
`assists/LiveAssistTool.kt`. That is an assist policy and belongs in
`OpenPocketViewCore` next to the rest; until it moves there, a third shell carrying its
own copy is a drift risk worth naming.

## Drawing to a window

`FeedRenderer::for_window` takes a window's raw handles and builds a swapchain; the
`watch` subcommand supplies them from winit. Present mode prefers mailbox — a field
monitor wants the freshest frame rather than a queue of stale ones — and falls back
through immediate to FIFO.

The swapchain path is tested without a display. `VK_EXT_headless_surface` gives a real
`VkSurfaceKHR` and a real swapchain, so acquire, submit, present, and recreate-on-resize
run the same code a window drives. `FeedRenderer::headless_window` is that constructor.

Two details worth keeping: the render-finished semaphore is per swapchain **image**, not
per frame in flight, because present waits on the signal for the image it is showing;
and descriptor sets are rewritten only when something they point at changes, since a
rewrite needs an idle device and doing it per frame would undo the frames in flight.

## What the core owns

`WatcherRelayProtocol`, `WatcherRelayFraming`, `WatcherRelayMessages`,
`WatcherRelayFrameBlob`, `WatcherRelayRecovery`, `WatcherRelayFrameFreshness`, and
`WatcherFocusPoint`. The ABI is defined in
[`opc_desktop_types.h`](../Sources/COpcDesktop/include/opc_desktop_types.h). Its record
layout is asserted from both sides — `DesktopAbiLayoutTests` in Swift and the `layout`
tests in `opc-core-sys` — so a field added on one side fails the other.

## Build and run

Prerequisites: a Swift toolchain, FFmpeg development libraries, a Vulkan loader, and a
GLSL compiler (`glslc` from the Vulkan SDK, or `glslangValidator` from glslang).

```sh
# Debian or Ubuntu
sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libvulkan-dev glslang-tools

just desktop-core     # build the Swift core as a shared library
just desktop-build    # build the Rust host against it
just desktop-check    # fmt, clippy, and the full Rust test suite
```

On Windows, point `FFMPEG_DIR` at a prebuilt shared FFmpeg (its `include/` and `lib/`)
and install the Vulkan SDK for `glslc`.

The shell links the Swift core, so `opc-watcher` needs `just desktop-core` first. The
library crates build and test without it; `build.rs` emits link flags only when the core
is present and says so when it is not.

Then, with the PC on the camera's Wi-Fi and Sharing on in the host's Operator Setup:

```sh
cd Apps/Desktop
cargo run -p opc-watcher -- list
cargo run -p opc-watcher -- watch "Studio iPhone" --look Contrast
cargo run -p opc-watcher -- join "Studio iPhone" --seconds 30 --dump feed.h265 --still first.png
cargo run -p opc-watcher -- decode feed.h265 --out stills --look Contrast --frames 10
```

`watch` opens the window. Keys: **L** cube, **Z** zebra, **P** peaking, **M** mirror,
**S** still, **Esc** quit.

`--dump` writes the received access units straight to disk. The host emits Annex-B with
parameter sets inline on every keyframe, so that file plays in `ffplay` or VLC with no
container — which is how you confirm the transport works.

`--still` decodes the live feed and writes the first picture through the whole pipeline,
and `decode` replays a dump through the same decoder and grade. Between them the path is
checked end to end before there is a window to draw in.

Without the Swift library the Rust workspace still type-checks and its pure-Rust tests
still run; `build.rs` only emits link flags when it finds the library, and says so
otherwise. Anything that calls the core fails at link rather than running a stub.

## Windows notes

- **Wi-Fi is an advantage here.** The camera's SoftAP carries no internet. A desktop with
  Ethernet for the network and a Wi-Fi adapter for the camera avoids the trade-off a
  phone cannot escape. Set the Wi-Fi interface metric higher than Ethernet so routing
  prefers the wire.
- **DLL placement.** Windows resolves DLLs beside the executable rather than by rpath, so
  `OpenPocketCineDesktop.dll` has to sit next to `opc-watcher.exe`. `OPC_CORE_LIB_DIR`
  covers the link step, not the run step.
- **Bonjour.** Discovery is pure Rust mDNS; it does not need Apple's Bonjour service
  installed. A firewall prompt on first run is expected — UDP 5353 inbound.

## Milestones

| # | Scope | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Discovery, join, telemetry, picture ingest, HEVC dump | In tree, **not physically verified** |
| 2a | Decode and grade: libavcodec, the Vulkan feed pipeline, the cube, PNG stills | In tree, **not physically verified** |
| 2b | A window: swapchain present, resize, zebra and peaking | In tree, **not physically verified** |
| 2c | Operator chrome: the HUD, the key map, tracking, the composite pass | In tree, **not physically verified** — [`desktop-viewfinder.md`](desktop-viewfinder.md) |
| 2d | False colour and the scopes | Not started |
| 3 | Direct camera session: BLE credential read, SoftAP join, UDP datalink, the ACK pump | Commands and transport exposed; the session itself not started — [`desktop-camera-link.md`](desktop-camera-link.md) |

Milestone 2d is false colour and the scopes. `feed.frag` already samples the limits paint
and weight cubes; what is missing is generating them, which `LiveColorScience.falseColorBands`
in the core already knows how to do — the Android facade builds a packed-2D variant for its
GLES fallback in `FeedEffectsWire`, and the desktop needs a 3D one through the same seam.
It is deliberately left until that facade work can be run against a Swift toolchain.
`blit.frag` already takes the `uvMode` rotation the phones use, which portrait chrome
will want.

Milestone 3 is where [`live-session.md`](live-session.md) becomes required reading. The
40 Hz window-ACK discipline is the thing most likely to produce a session that connects,
shows telemetry, and never shows a picture. `Hevc.stripDjiMarker` in the core becomes
relevant there too: the relay's re-encode is clean, but the camera's own stream carries
DJI's private per-frame marker.

## Verification

`just desktop-check` is the desktop gate. It is **not** proof of operator-visible
behavior: per [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), that needs a real camera, a real host phone,
and a real PC.

What is actually checked today: the decoder against a committed synthetic HEVC stream,
the Annex-B splitter, the relay's receive buffer and discovery filtering, the ABI record
layout from both sides, and the feed pipeline rendering real decoded pictures — black and
white landing where limited range says they should, chroma moving hue the way BT.709
says, mirroring reflecting the picture, raster changes rebuilding cleanly, and a frame
surviving decode, grade, and PNG encode. Zebra stripes rather than floods and leaves a
dark picture alone; peaking strokes a hard edge, finds it in the right column, leaves a
flat picture alone, and survives being toggled between frames. The swapchain acquires,
presents, rebuilds on resize, survives a minimised window, and keeps presenting past the
frames-in-flight count. These run on whatever Vulkan device is present, including a
software one, and skip rather than fail where there is none.

The viewfinder's own behaviour is checked the same way: the key map, the gimbal stick,
the countdown, the format ladder, the tracking arithmetic and the chrome are decided by
`opc_monitor::shell`, which has no window, no GPU and no camera in it, and five further
tests drive that shell and the renderer together on a software device so that chrome
which is decided correctly but never composited is caught.

What is not checked: nothing has been run against a live host or a camera. No real
window has been opened — the swapchain is exercised through a headless surface, so
winit, the platform surface extensions, and the event loops in
`crates/opc-watcher/src/watch.rs` and `crates/opc-monitor/src/view.rs` are unrun. And the Swift facade has no Swift toolchain in the authoring environment, so
its own tests and the Rust tests that call it are written but unrun. The
grade-matches-the-core comparison in `crates/opc-render/tests/lut_grade.rs` is the one to
run first on a machine with Swift.
