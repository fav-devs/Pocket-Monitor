# Live performance budgets

The picture is the product. Chrome, scopes, and SET traffic ride around it.
Target hardware is mid/high-end: iPhone 13-class and newer; Android API 33+
with ≥4 GB RAM (the Kyant glass gate). Prove **physical** after any live-path
change.

Numbers that already have a home stay there. This file is the SLO index and the
rules that are not in those homes. Changing a budget is a code + docs change in
the same PR.

## Budgets

| Surface | Budget | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live picture | Present at the camera’s live rate. Typical Pocket/Nano SoftAP is ~25 fps 720p. Do not pace decode at 30 fps. A 4K 50p body may present 50 Hz 720p. Skip duplicate timestamps; latest-wins if a LUT bake is busy. Runtime grade cap 1440 px (`FeedPresentPolicy.maxWorkingWidth`). | [`live-session.md`](live-session.md), `FeedPresentPolicy` |
| Playback LUT | 720p proxy with the official cube stays at a usable rate on iPhone 13-class (picture first; same class as LUT-off). Native 420 IOSurface → GPU cube at `maxWorkingWidth`. Pull clock follows the display (24–120 Hz); `hasNewPixelBuffer` gates the cube — do not cap the display link at 24. No `AVVideoComposition` for preview. Scope tap stays off the present thread. Android playback is the live GLES session (OES → cube); no TextureView `getBitmap`. | `PlaybackFeedSession`, `PlaybackFeedView` |
| Watcher relay (iOS) | Same camera Wi-Fi for host and watchers; no peer-to-peer fallback. One encode; two admitted source frames; two video sends per authorized watcher, separate from control traffic; one pending state send at 5 Hz. Encode and fan-out off MainActor. Forced relay keyframes ≤1 Hz. | [`watcher-relay.md`](watcher-relay.md) |
| Window ACK | pktType `0x04` at **40 Hz**, three groups: video `0x02` seq, ackedData `0x03` seq, telemetry extra | [`live-session.md`](live-session.md) |
| Live enable | **Enable-once.** Further enables follow the watchdog only | `AGENTS.md`, [`feed-watchdog.md`](feed-watchdog.md) |
| Stall / recover | 2 s UDP silence is a stall; 8 s GOP grace after `0x09/0xa8`; 4 s after an AF-C SET; 5 s between enables; 60 s UDP rebuild backoff. Encoder pause (young status) never rebuilds UDP | `FeedWatchdog`, [`feed-watchdog.md`](feed-watchdog.md) |
| HUD chrome | 5 Hz (`LiveChromeThrottle.statusInterval` = 0.2 s). REC, format, color, zoom, and the other `isImmediate` fields bypass | `LiveChromeThrottle` |
| Scope tap | 25 Hz with 1–2 scopes, 10 Hz with 3+ (`PocketScopeSampler`). 200-wide downsample (213×120 on 720p SoftAP). Thermal ×3 serious / ×5 critical. A 50 Hz proxy still skips. Assists-off is one blit — no 1280×720 histogram or readback per frame | [`ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md) I/O; iOS present path matches the rate |
| HUD glass sample | PixelCopy ~20 Hz when Kyant cannot sample the SurfaceView | [`ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md) |
| Zoom pinch | Distinct lens ticks at 20 Hz, no ACK wait | [`PARITY.md`](PARITY.md) |
| Gimbal stick | `0x04/0x01` notify at **25 Hz** on the UDP ACK queue while held; one rest packet on lift. Not MainActor `sendUntracked` (that starved window ACK). AirPods IMU samples ~100 Hz off main; a 25 Hz pump publishes native targets to a latest-only mailbox. Native wire emission has a 40 ms minimum interval on the 25 ms ACK timer (typically 20 Hz). Duplicate targets are suppressed; a not-ready socket cannot accumulate a backlog. HUD at the 5 Hz chrome budget. Head-track yaw/pitch rings (head + gimbal arrows) follow the 25 Hz pump while Head Tracking is on (not the 5 Hz HUD). Motion Control waypoint letters follow the 25 Hz stick budget — not 60 Hz `TimelineView.animation` / `withFrameNanos` on the live canvas (that starved ingest and flashed Reconnecting). Motion Control session progress is 5 Hz; no debug overlay is drawn. Timed-path ticks use monotonic elapsed time; a gap over 120 ms or attitude receipt age over 300 ms aborts the take. Physical precision remains unqualified ([Motion Control takes](programmed-moves.md)). | `GimbalStick.streamInterval`, iOS `DatalinkDriver.tickGimbalStick`, `HeadphoneMotionBridge` |
| Battery | Sticky `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` (Android); no 1 Hz poll | [`ANDROID.md`](../ANDROID.md) |
| Watch preview | Ack-paced JPEG, drop-stale, **3** outstanding across wrist wake/resume (fps ≈ depth/RTT; one in flight was ~12 fps). Encode on a detached queue so the three slots overlap. Identity JPEG is `VTCreateCGImageFromCVPixelBuffer` (same family as the phone layer — a DeviceRGB CI bake was a Rec.709 contrast shift). LUT cubes stay unmanaged. Adaptive 320 / 416 / 512 px. A paired, installed companion requests the existing VT decoder even with AF-S and assists off; wrist sleep stops JPEG work without restarting decode. Rec/tally uses `updateApplicationContext` when not reachable. | `WatchRelay` |

Programmed takes run on the background transport scheduler, using complete-frame
attitude receipts before the UI hop. Smoothed paths write 20 Hz native targets
directly at monotonic deadlines under exclusive ownership; UI progress is 5 Hz. Marker/curve projection uses the existing 25 Hz overlay timeline;
measured motion prediction is display-only. No new ACK timer or video enable
is introduced. Native stream targets are not logged individually at 20 Hz.

## Image anchoring experiment

A temporary iPhone 16 Pro Max benchmark of Vision homography registration at
320 pixels wide and 5 Hz measured 30 jobs: mean 42.6 ms, p95 68.9 ms, maximum
800.3 ms including cold start. A concurrent movement test interrupted on timing.
This does not establish causation, but the cost is unsuitable for enabling by
default. The probe was removed; production waypoint projection performs no
image registration. Background transport checks without the probe sustained
approximately 25 fps through normal and fast smoothed takes.

## Threading

UDP receive re-arms on the network queue, not after a main-actor hop. A busy HUD
must not stop the socket.

Desktop debug builds retain symbols and assertions but compile the Rust dev profile at
`opt-level = 2`; a completely unoptimised 720p plane copy and software HUD is not a
meaningful camera-performance build. The window/Vulkan presenter remains on its owner
thread; network and camera-session pumping remain independent of it.

Depacketize and scope accumulation stay off the UI thread. Compose/SwiftUI
invalidates at the HUD budget, not per video packet.

Keep the last decoded frame through recover, and across extra-mirror
(3 frames / 120 ms) so TT180 does not X-flip the on-screen picture in
place. Empty samples and
`flushAndRemoveImage` before the next picture are a black well, not a stall.
A 2 s gap with no present is a **freeze** (`FeedPresentPolicy.isFrozen`) —
UDP still alive means do not send `0x09/0xa8`. Skip duplicate timestamps
on the GPU path; if a LUT bake is still in flight, drop to the latest sample.
Metal present is latest-wins with **one drawable in flight**
(`FeedPresentPolicy.maxInFlightMetalPresents`). Do not block MainActor on
`nextDrawable` — LUT 50/50 plus PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA pipelined baker
completions and froze ingest until force-quit (#218). Skip the acquire
and present the newest bake when a drawable returns.
Runtime grade stays at `FeedPresentPolicy.maxWorkingWidth` (1440 px) on the
720p proxy — do not memcpy a 4K original to apply a cube. Live LUT replace
hides the HEVC layer once Metal owns the picture. Playback does the same:
`AVPlayerItemVideoOutput` pulls Metal-compatible 420 (not 32BGRA),
`LiveAssistEngine` grades on a pull queue, and `CIFeedView` is a **sibling**
of `AVPlayerLayer` under a plain UIView (same stacking as live
`DisplayLayerView`). Nesting `CAMetalLayer` inside `AVPlayerLayer` presents
LUT replace as a black plate; overlay stripes still showed through. Once
Metal owns the cube, hide the player — a second HEVC present under the grade
is the hitch. Overlay (PEAK / FALSE / ZEBRA) keeps the identity layer.
Export bake stays `AVVideoComposition`. The cube bakes at feed resolution and
bilinear-fits the panel; Lanczos / MetalFX stay opt-in Quality/AI. Android
live matches that order (Vulkan / GLES cube 720p, then stretch Rec.709). The baker
pipelines the next cube while the GPU finishes the last. Next/prev clip does
not recreate the playback `CAMetalLayer` — a slide `.id` rebuild stole the
session and left LUT off until the chip was cycled. Playback Auto reads
2 MiB from the **original** take's tail once per item
(`ClipColorProfile.fileTailBytes`) — never the LRF/XRF sidecar, not the 4K
`mdat`, not per frame. When the original is not cached, that tail is an HTTP
Range.

Offscreen / hidden processed feeds set `isEnabled = false` (no Metal/GLES).
Replace-grade unhides the drawable **before** `nextDrawable`; overlay stays
hidden until the transparent bake lands. `nextDrawable` must not block the
UI thread (`allowsNextDrawableTimeout` on iOS).

## Hardware

Kyant liquid glass: API 33+ and ≥4 GB, not `isLowRamDevice`. FULL stays FULL —
no frame-budget demote. Older / low-RAM devices stay on solid frost.

Decoder prefers hardware (`c2.qti` / Exynos, VideoToolbox) over a software
fallback. GLES `FeedEffectsGlProgram` is the Android decode fallback when
Vulkan cannot init.

`WIFI_MODE_FULL_LOW_LATENCY` stays on while live.

## When this pointer fires

A live-path, HUD, scope, ACK, playback-LUT, or smoothness change. After the
edit, the row you touched still matches its owner, and the picture is
**physical** at the camera’s live rate on mid/high-end hardware. Playback LUT
on a 720p proxy is the same bar.
