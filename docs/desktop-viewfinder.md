# The desktop viewfinder

`opc-monitor` is the laptop as a viewfinder: a window on the camera itself, with every
control the camera has. It can also sit on the feed an iPhone is sharing (see [Watching
a phone](#watching-a-phone)), which is what the older `opc-watcher` did with a bare
window; here the same picture gets the assists, the scopes, the LUTs and the virtual
camera.

```
opc-monitor view [--camera HOST:PORT] [--look NAME | --lut FILE] [--model ID]
                 [--still PATH]
opc-monitor view --phone NAME [--phone-at IP:PORT] [--passcode P]
opc-monitor keys
```

Join the camera's Wi-Fi first. Bluetooth pairing will do that from here once the platform
BLE transport lands; the state machine behind it is already in `opc-camera`.

## What it looks like

On a saved camera, Windows gets a short 12-second opportunity to rejoin its protected
Wi-Fi profile. If the camera is off or its network is unavailable, the app moves straight
to the connection screen rather than leaving the desktop blank through Windows' long
WLAN timeout.

The picture fills the window, keeping its proportions — a 16:9 feed in a window the
operator dragged square gets bars, not narrow faces. Framing is what a viewfinder is for.

The chrome is a DJI Mimo replica laid out for a landscape laptop, rendered by Slint
(`opc-chrome`, Outfit type, Tabler icons) into a transparent overlay the shell composites
over the picture:

- **Top bar** — menu, gimbal follow `ON`/`OFF`, the format chip (`1080p · 60p`, the
  phones' shape, with the aspect when it is not 16:9), the
  exposure mode chip (`AUTO`/`M`), the link state in the middle with a red `REC` badge
  and running time while the body is rolling, and exit at the far right.
- **Zoom ruler** — a dotted ruler under the top bar that slides beneath a fixed ring;
  drag it to zoom, the label under it is the truth. The body's own chip stops are marked
  on it (Pocket 4 Pro 1× / 3× / 6× / 12×; Pocket 4 and Pocket 3 1× / 2× / 4×, 2× at most
  for a Pocket 3 in 4K; 1× only in slow motion, timelapse and low light; Nano 1×), and
  `+` / `-` step between them. A body with only 1× greys the ruler. D-Log2 rejects every
  zoom, so a zoom off 1× first hops the colour to D-Log, waits for the body to report
  it, then zooms; parking back at 1× puts D-Log2 back. Rolling in D-Log2 locks the zoom,
  and the top bar says so.
- **Exposure plate** (left) — shutter, `ISO`, `EV` and `WB` readouts. A field the camera
  has not reported is absent rather than guessed.
- **Status plate** (right) — Wi-Fi, battery (red at 20 %), card time left, and the rate
  actually reaching the screen.
- **Bottom bar** — gallery, flip and orientation next to the joystick on the left; the
  record button in the middle (a red disc, a red square while rolling, white in photo
  mode); `CTR`, `FOLLOW`, `STILL` and fullscreen on the right; and the mode strip
  (`TIMELAPSE · SLOWMOTION · LOW-LIGHT · VIDEO · PHOTO · HYPERLAPSE`) with the active
  mode in Mimo yellow. Pano and Livestream have no SET the phones send, so the strip
  does not show them. Photo goes out as the body's own byte (`0x05` on a Pocket 3 or
  Nano, `0x17` on a Pocket 4), Live Photo reads as PHOTO, and the strip refuses a
  change while the body is rolling. In a stills mode the record button takes the
  picture.

`V` cycles the gimbal's Follow, Tilt Locked and FPV modes without opening Settings;
the Settings → Camera tab remains the place to set gimbal speed and ramp.
- **Middle** — only a phase message (`WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW`, `APPROVE ON THE CAMERA`,
  `RECOVERING FEED`), the take countdown, or a failure. Before the first decoded
  picture, the window presents this chrome over black rather than leaving the native
  window's white surface exposed. A renderer failure is also named in the window title
  and terminal output.

Three sheets open over the picture and close on `Esc`, the `×`, or a tap outside:

- **Format** (the format chip) — the resolutions and frame rates the body listed, and
  nothing else. Picking a size keeps the rate when that size offers it.
- **Exposure** (`AUTO`/`M` chip, or `E`) — `Auto`/`Manual`, then ISO and shutter for
  manual, ISO max and EV for auto. The rows the mode does not use are drawn greyed, the
  way Mimo shows them. **Shutter units** reads the shutter as a **Speed** (1/N) or an
  **Angle**: the phones' stops from 5.6° to 360°, converted at the current frame rate
  (an unknown rate counts as 24) and snapped to the body's published list, so 180° at
  25p is 1/50.
- **Settings** (`⋮`, or `Tab`) — nine tabs. A sheet taller than the window scrolls
  with the wheel, and a row with more chips than fit (ISO, shutter, EV, a Pocket 3's
  formats) slides sideways under the wheel too, since a mouse cannot drag a strip the
  way a finger does. A sheet stays on screen in the clean display, so the Display
  tab's own `Clean` chip cannot take the menu away with it. **Camera:** focus mode, focus-track mode (Default / Product Showcase / Subject Lock / Registered Priority), white balance
  presets, colour profile (from the body's own list), field of view, gimbal mode,
  speed and **ramp** (Off / Soft / Medium, the phones' first-order ease on the stick,
  applied to the arrow keys and the on-screen pad alike). White balance has the
  presets, then a **Kelvin** row over the whole custom range (2000–10000 K) and a
  **Tint** row (−100…+100), each keeping the other's value. Gimbal mode offers Follow,
  Tilt locked, FPV and **Direction lock**. On a Nano, which has no focus mode, the
  Focus rows are not shown. The field of view and gimbal speed go to the body once when
  a link comes up, since the body does not report them. The gimbal mode chip follows
  the body's own heartbeat when it says the family changed (FPV or follow), so a mode
  set on the body reads right here. **Audio:** channel and vocal boost (both read
  from the body on connect, so the chips show what the camera is set to rather than
  the last pick), wind noise reduction and directional audio (All / Front / Front+back). The
  last two live in one DSP blob (`@2` of the `0x02/0xA0` GET reply): the tab reads
  the blob when it opens, the rows stay greyed until it has answered, and a pick
  sends the body's own 26 bytes back with `@2` patched (`0x02/0x9F`) followed by a
  fresh read, so the chips show what took rather than what was asked. **Assist:** thirds grid, overexposure alert (zebra),
  focus peaking, the **LUT** row (Off, the core's official Rec.709 cubes, then every
  `.cube` the operator dropped into the LUT folder the row names), mirror, the timecode
  in the top bar, and the `T` countdown length (3, 5 or 10 s).

  **Link:** the transport and address, the link phase, the body and its firmware, what
  the watchdog last did, and a **Reconnect** that tears the datalink down and opens a
  fresh session. **Controls:** joystick sensitivity (the phones' 1–5 ticks through the
  core's stick curve, for the on-screen pad and a controller; the arrow keys keep their
  fixed throw), the gimbal ramp, and the **game controller** switch with the phones'
  map: left stick pans and tilts, the triggers hold-to-zoom at the phones' rate, A
  records, B recentres, X flips, Y clears tracking, the shoulders step the zoom stops,
  the D-pad walks ISO and shutter along the body's own lists. **Display:** DISP 1 / 2
  (live or clean, the same as `H`) and which parts of the chrome are drawn — exposure
  plate, status plate, zoom ruler, gimbal pad, mode strip; the phones' screen flip has
  no laptop meaning and says so. **Storage:** the media cache's size on disk and a
  **Clear**, and where the LUT folder is. **System:** the app version, what speaks the
  protocol, the renderer, a **diagnostics report** written next to the LUT folder, and
  where the source and licences are. Everything the operator sets here is kept in
  `desktop-prefs.txt` beside the LUT folder and read back on the next start.
- **Assist toolbar** (`ASSIST` in the top bar, or `A`) — the phones' fifteen-tool
  strip under the top bar: `LUT PEAK FALSE | ZEBRA WAVE PARADE | HISTO VECTOR LIGHTS
  ND | GUIDES GRID CROSS | MIRROR | AUDIO`. A tap flips the tool; a long press or a
  right click opens its options as a sheet. **False colour** paints the core's
  CineStop, EL Zone, IRE or Limits lattices for the body's colour mode and ISO (the
  same two cubes the phones sample), with a reference key along the bottom of the
  picture. **Peaking** has the phones' sensitivity (Low / Med / High) and stroke
  colour. **Zebra** has highlight and midtone bands, each with its level (in IRE, or
  read as 0–255 codes on the feed, which the core converts) and stripe colour; the
  thresholds land on the feed's own axis per colour mode. **Grid** draws thirds, the
  phi grid and dotted diagonals in any mix; **Guides** draws the Film or Social
  aspect frames (several at once) with an optional mask outside them; **Cross** is
  the centre crosshair. The **scopes** are movable plates over the picture, sized as
  on the phones, read from the decoded picture on the CPU at about 15 Hz: **WAVE**
  (luma or RGB overlay, with the clip / crush / middle-grey guides), **PARADE** (RGB
  or YRGB lanes), **HISTO** (RGB fills and the luma line on the waveform's axis,
  the clip zone at 95), **VECTOR** (chroma trace on the 75% graticule with the 123°
  skin line; trace zoom 1× / 2× / 4×), **LIGHTS** (three lamps, clip and crush per
  channel, with the crush / clip compensation), **ND** (the suggested screw-on
  filter in stops, factor or density) and **AUDIO** (the body's own meters with
  peak hold). The axis each plate plots on — where 0, 100 and 18% grey fall for the
  body's colour mode and ISO — is the core's `ScopeDisplayScale`, and the lights and
  the ND reading are the core's from the histograms; the desktop only samples and
  draws. Drag a plate anywhere to park it somewhere else.

A chip lights up when the camera confirms the value, not when it is tapped; a setting
the body never reports (audio channel, field of view, gimbal speed) is kept as last
commanded.

## Programmed moves

`K` opens the Moves sheet: **Set here** captures the body's live pose into A, B or an
optional C (the sheet shows the live pan and tilt as the camera reports them), the
`A → B` and `B → C` rows pick each leg's duration, and **Start** counts 3-2-1, closes
the sheet and runs the take with a readout in the top bar. **Stop**, any arrow key,
or the pad cancels it with a native stop.

The engine is the core's `GimbalMoveEngine` transcribed (`opc-monitor/moves.rs`) minus
smoothing at B and pause / resume: the approach to A in steps under 120° at 120°/s,
a two-second hold, one native timed target (`0x04/0x14`) per exact leg, legs over 180°
or 25.5 s split into native parts along the reachable arc, every target checked
against attitude no older than 300 ms so the firmware can never take the route
through the missing sector, and a final check that the camera stopped within 0.15°.
A late boundary dispatch (over 40 ms, the window's draw loop being no scheduler)
stops the take. Attitude reaches the desktop as the `0x04/0x05` yaw, display tilt and
native pitch the facade now reads out with every status. Timing and positional
accuracy are unqualified on a body; see `docs/programmed-moves.md`.

## The library

The gallery button, or `G`, opens Mimo's album over the picture: **Device** (the card)
or **Local** (only what is on this machine), `All · Photos · Videos · Favorites` pills,
a sort chip (`Newest · Oldest · Name · Rating`) and Refresh. Tiles are grouped under
day headers (`Today`, then the date), carry Mimo's download mark until the original is
on disk, the clip length, and a star for favourites; there are no file names on the
grid. Tapping a tile fills the bar along the bottom with its name, duration, size and
resolution, and the actions:

- **PLAY** fetches the 720p `.LRF` proxy to the cache and opens the player on it; the
  original is the fallback when there is no proxy. **VIEW** does the same for a still.
- **DOWNLOAD** fetches the original into the library folder, with a progress bar.
- **STAR** flips the favourite locally and tells the camera when the record carries a
  handle to tell it with.
- **DELETE** arms on the first tap and sends on the second. Only a handle the core's
  base + step fit vouched for ever goes out; a shared or unfitted handle greys the
  button. A delete is irreversible.

**Select** in the header turns the grid into the phones' multi-select: every tile gets
a check circle, the footer counts the checks, and **Delete selected** arms on the first
tap and sends one delete per checked file on the second, again only for handles the fit
vouched for. **Done** leaves select mode and forgets the checks.

A burst (`…_0034_D_001.JPG`, `_002`, … — the core's `burstRegex`) is one tile carrying
its first frame and a `×N` badge, as the phones fold it; the selection bar offers
**Expand ×N**, which lays every member out as its own tile, and **Fold burst** to put
it back. In select mode a folded burst checks as its lead only.

Listing follows the phones' sequence and the Osmosis notes for the bodies that need
them: enter playback (`0x02/0x0c`, three tries), fall through to the Pocket 3's
`0x01/0x01` entry at 20 Hz when the body refuses, wait 1.7 s for the store to mount,
then list the internal store, the trigger, and the card, and collect until the camera
goes quiet. Older pages walk the oldest video handle down while playback holds; a body
that never enters still lists its newest page. The catalogue itself is decoded by the
Swift core through the facade — no manifest byte is read in Rust — and the last list
and the local stars are kept per camera under the platform cache folder, so the
library opens instantly next time.

Closing the library exits playback until the body's playback bit clears and then asks
for live view again, the same loop the phones run.

## The player

The proxy plays through the feed pipeline, so the LUT, zebra, peaking and mirror keys
work on it exactly as on live view. The page is Mimo's: back, an info button that
shows the clip's name and figures, the rendition as the title (`Low-Res` for the
proxy), a download button for the original; below, the time pill, a filmstrip scrubber
of eight frames decoded from the clip with the playhead over it, the tools
(Screenshot writes the graded frame with `S`; LUT, Zebra and Peaking toggle; the
conform chip), and heart · pause · trash. `Space` pauses, `Esc` goes back to the library; trash arms on
the first tap and deletes on the second. A still is converted to the same 4:2:0
path, so it is graded too. Playback is from the file on disk, never streamed from
`/v2`: the camera parks `moov` at the end and serves no extension, which no player
copes with.

**Sound.** The clip's audio track plays through the machine's default output. The
reader decodes it beside the pictures, resampled to the device's rate as interleaved
stereo, and the player hands it to the device a little ahead of the frame on screen —
80 ms, enough to ride out a late frame — dropping anything already behind the clock
after a scrub. Pause holds the device; a seek clears it; any speed but the clip's own
(the conform preview) plays silent. A clip without an audio track, or a machine with no
output device, plays as before. Live view has no sound to play: the datalink carries
pictures and the camera's own meter readings, not audio.

**Conform preview.** A high-frame-rate take offers the core's `ConformPreview` targets
(the rates below its capture rate, from `opc_conform_targets`); the chip cycles
`Conform → 120 → 24 → 120 → 60 → Conform`, and the player's clock runs at the core's
`opc_conform_speed` ratio so the slow-motion delivery can be judged before the edit.
The chip is greyed on a clip with nothing to conform to. Opening a clip resets it.

**Auto LUT.** When the original is on disk, the player reads the take's `moov` tail
(the last 2 MiB) through the core's `ClipColorProfile` — the `com.dji.camera.ColorGammaSxS`
key — and asks the core for the official cube's file name for that colour and body
(`OfficialDJILUT.auto`). If the operator has dropped that cube into the LUT folder it
is applied and the notice reads `AUTO LUT · OFFICIAL CUBE FOR THE CLIP`; otherwise the
notice names the file to drop in. A proxy with no original falls back to the body's
live colour mode. The desktop never ships the cubes.

Every button carries its key hint in small type, so a keyboard operator learns the
bindings from the screen. When the window is wider than the picture, the two plates park
in the black gutters and leave the shot clean.

Each cluster is a self-contained Slint component with its own anchor, so a later edit
mode can move them without touching their internals.

`H` hides all of it. To look at the chrome without a camera or a window:

```
cargo run -p opc-chrome --example snapshot -- <dir>
```

writes PNGs of the finding, live, recording, failed and wide-window states.

## The viewfinder as a camera

The **Output** tab in Settings hands the graded picture to other apps, so a call, a
stream or a recorder can take the Pocket as its webcam. It is 1280 × 720, letterboxed
as the window is, without the chrome, at up to 30 frames a second; the **Camera
picture** row sends it **Clean** (the LUT stays, zebra / peaking / false colour come
off) or **As shown**. The feed goes out on the viewfinder and in the player; the
library sends nothing. The **Camera output** readout says where the frames are going,
or why they are not.

The tab opens with the platform's **camera component**: what it is here, whether it is
installed, and an **Install** / **Remove** row that does the platform's own thing and
asks the platform's own way — a password prompt through `pkexec` on Linux, the
administrator prompt for `regsvr32` on Windows, the OpenPocketCine Camera app on macOS.
The check runs when the viewfinder starts and again after every action, off the window
thread; the **Detail** readout says where the component is, what installing would do,
or why it could not. Picking **Camera device** before the component is in puts a notice
on the top bar pointing here. Once an install lands, the camera restarts on its own.
With the **Stream** on, **Open in the browser** shows the page any browser renders it
on.

- **Camera device** is the platform's own camera, so every app that opens a webcam sees
  "OpenPocketCine" without OBS in between:
  - **Linux** writes to a `v4l2loopback` device, found by asking every `/dev/video*`
    for its driver. **Install** loads the module with `exclusive_caps=1` and the
    OpenPocketCine label and keeps it across reboots (`/etc/modules-load.d` and
    `/etc/modprobe.d`); without `pkexec` the tab shows the one line to run instead:

    ```sh
    sudo modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1 card_label=OpenPocketCine
    ```

    The device takes packed YUYV (BT.601), set with the kernel's own `VIDIOC_S_FMT`;
    the struct layouts and ioctl numbers are pinned by tests against
    `<linux/videodev2.h>`.
  - **Windows 11 (22H2 or later)** registers a Media Foundation virtual camera for the
    session with `MFCreateVirtualCamera`. Its media source is `opc_vcam_win.dll`
    (`crates/opc-vcam-win`), a COM object the Windows Camera Frame Server loads into its
    own service; the viewfinder feeds it NV12 frames over the named pipe
    `\\.\pipe\OpenPocketCineVCam` (`opc_vcam::wire`), and the source paces them out at
    30 frames a second, black while nothing is coming. **Install** registers the DLL
    that sits beside the viewfinder through an elevated `regsvr32` (the administrator
    prompt is the consent); the tab reads the registration back from the machine hive
    and says when the DLL is missing beside the executable. The Windows installer
    (`build-installer.ps1`, see `docs/DESKTOP.md`) registers it during setup, so a
    viewfinder installed that way shows the component as installed from the first run. Nothing is signed and
    nothing runs in the kernel. On Windows 10 the tab reports the component as not
    available; use the stream there.
  - **macOS 13 or later** writes into the sink stream of the OpenPocketCine camera
    extension, a CoreMediaIO extension installed once from the OpenPocketCine Camera app
    (`Apps/Desktop/macos`, an XcodeGen project). The facade finds the device and its
    sink stream by name through CoreMediaIO and enqueues NV12 sample buffers
    (`opc_vcam_mac_*`); the extension hands the newest frame to every reader at 30
    frames a second. **Install** opens the OpenPocketCine Camera app from
    `/Applications`, where one button activates the extension; the tab says when the
    app is not there. The extension needs the system-extension entitlement, so the app
    must be Developer ID signed by a team in the Apple Developer Program.
- **Stream** serves MJPEG over HTTP on `127.0.0.1` (port 8890 in the settings file,
  `vcam_port`): `/stream` is a `multipart/x-mixed-replace` body that never ends,
  `/frame.jpg` the latest frame, `/` a page that shows it. Nothing leaves the machine.
  In OBS add a **Media Source**, untick Local File, set the input to the URL the
  System tab shows and the input format to `mjpeg`, then **Start Virtual Camera** —
  OBS's camera is what Zoom, Teams, Meet and the rest pick up on every platform. VLC,
  ffmpeg and a browser read the stream directly.

Frames are handed to a worker thread through a latest-wins slot, so a slow consumer
never holds the window back. The setting persists with the rest.

None of the three camera devices has been run against its platform here: the Linux
path is pinned to the kernel header, the Windows source is type-checked against the
real bindings on the Windows target, and the macOS extension and facade are written to
Apple's camera-extension pattern but not compiled. Each needs one run on its machine.

## The camera on your Wi-Fi

The camera normally hosts its own network and the PC has to join it, which costs the PC
its internet. The Pocket can instead join a network you name — station mode, the same
role the phone apps use for their multi-camera stage — and then the viewfinder finds it
on your own Wi-Fi and links it there directly, with every control, while the PC stays
online.

Pair as usual. On the **Pairing complete** screen pick **Put the camera on my Wi-Fi
instead**, type the network's name (the PC's own is filled in) and its password, and
press **Join Wi-Fi**. Over Bluetooth the app then reads the camera's identity, asks its
Wi-Fi role, switches it to station mode and reads the role back until the radio has
turned, gives the radio ten seconds, and sends the join, up to three times as the core's
policy allows. The password goes to the camera and is not kept on the PC. Then the app
looks for the camera: every address on the PC's network is asked for the camera's poke
port, and each that answers is opened as a datalink and asked for its Wi-Fi identity,
which has to match what the camera said over Bluetooth. Only that match makes an
address the camera's.

Once found, the network name, the identity and the address are remembered beside the
saved-camera file, and every later launch looks there first, last address before the
subnet, with no Wi-Fi change and no Bluetooth. If the camera is not on the network the
launch falls through to the saved camera Wi-Fi and then the pairing screen. **Return
the camera to its own Wi-Fi**, on the same screen, puts it back in access-point mode
and forgets the network.

What to know:

- Use a 2.4 GHz network, or one that offers 2.4 GHz alongside 5 GHz; the cameras' radios
  do not all take every 5 GHz channel. WPA2-Personal is what has been seen to work.
- Routers with client isolation (a guest network, usually) let the camera join but keep
  the PC from reaching it. The search then fails with a note saying so.
- The search walks at most a /22. A bigger subnet is refused rather than scanned.
- Pocket 3 and Nano may answer the role query with "no such getter"; the app switches
  them without a readback, as the phone apps do. The Pocket 4 family is asked to select
  video mode first. Other bodies are treated strictly.
- The join reply sometimes never comes over Bluetooth. The app then searches anyway,
  since a lost reply is not a failed join.

The order and every reply reading come from the core's station commands and policies,
observed on hardware by the upstream project; none of it has been run from this PC yet.

## Watching a phone

An iPhone running OpenPocketCine can share its camera session: Operator Setup › Sharing
› **Share this feed**. The phone keeps the camera link, decodes once, re-encodes, and
serves watchers on the camera's Wi-Fi. The viewfinder can be one of them, so the phone
does the pairing and the laptop does the monitoring, and both see the picture at once.

Join the camera's Wi-Fi on the PC first; hosts are only advertised there. The connection
screen's **Watch a phone's shared feed** lists the phones it finds, takes the passcode if
the phone set one, and opens the viewfinder on the one you pick. From a shell,
`--phone NAME` finds the phone by its advertised name, `--phone-at IP:PORT` skips the
search, and the passcode comes from `--passcode` or `OPC_PHONE_PASSCODE`.

What changes on a phone's feed:

- The picture is the phone's re-encode of the identity raster: after extra-mirror,
  before its own LUT and assists. Every assist, scope and cube here works on it, and so
  does the virtual camera. There is no audio on the wire, so the meters stay dark.
- The readouts come from the phone's state message: record, battery, ISO, shutter, the
  format label, the zoom. The FORMAT chip shows the phone's label rather than the
  camera's codes.
- Control is a lease the phone grants. The first proxied control you touch asks for it
  and the phone's operator sees Grant / Deny; the Link tab shows who holds it and has
  **Request** / **Release**. With the lease, record, tap to focus, ISO, shutter, white
  balance, colour and zoom go through. The gimbal, the format, tracking, motion control,
  audio and the library need the camera's own link, and say so on the top bar when
  asked.
- **Reconnect** on the Link tab joins the phone again. The core's retry ladder runs first
  on a drop, and the phone can revoke the lease at any time.

None of this has met a real phone yet; the wire is the same core code the phone encodes
with, so a mismatch is a bug, not a design gap.

## What is remembered

Everything the operator sets up is saved beside the LUT folder (`desktop-prefs.txt`)
the moment it changes and comes back at the next start: the setup tabs, which assists
and scopes are on, how each is set (zebra thresholds and colours, peaking colour and
sensitivity, the false-colour scale, grid lines, guide frames and mask, waveform mode
and guides, parade mode, vectorscope gain, brightness, the ND notation), and the cube
in use. Nothing the camera reports is remembered; the camera is asked again.

## Keys

Two arrows at once pan diagonally, and two opposite arrows rest the stick — the gimbal
takes one position, not a stream of presses, so the held directions are added up and sent
as one. The stick is re-sent every 200 ms while held, which is a keepalive rather than
the thing that makes it move, and it rests the moment the key comes up.

## Pointer controls

The bars are a desktop operator surface, not scaled-up phone chrome. The record button,
`STILL`, flip, `CTR` and the mode strip carry the existing typed commands. The gimbal
follow chip and `FOLLOW` button send the same SET frames as the mobile gimbal sheet
(`Follow` → `Tilt locked` → `FPV`). The format chip opens the format sheet. The joystick is a **hold** control: pressing or moving it
sends the matching stick axes and release, cancellation, focus loss, and window close
send a centred stick immediately. Controls are at least 44 px, and they are greyed and
disabled while the link is recovering or failed.

A finger drags a tracking box on the unobstructed fitted image, exactly as the mouse
does. A press that starts in a control stays a control — it can never become tracking.
The box is drawn as Mimo's corner brackets: white while the Pocket is still searching,
green once it has the subject. There are no words on the picture; the camera supplies
a subject box and lock state, not a person’s name or identity.
Keyboard shortcuts remain available.

A click (or a tap) that is not a drag is **tap-to-focus**: Mimo's four-write burst
(`0x22` spot, `0x30` region, `0x68` hint, `0x32` commit) at that point on the sensor,
mirroring undone, with a bracketed reticle and the AE spot marked at its corner for
1.5 s. As on the phones the spot and the region go first and the hint and commit wait
for the region's ACK (or 0.4 s, if the body never answers). A body already following
something is told to stop first. The Nano takes no tap focus, so a click on one sends
nothing.

A drag's box goes to the body as **centre and size** (`0x02/0xA6`), which is what
Mimo sends; a box with a side under 9 % of the picture is refused with `FRAME TOO
SMALL`, since that is where the official app stops sending too. The box is then
**polled** on the phones' cadence (`0x02/0xA5` every 0.5 s) and, once the body has
locked, driven by its own `0x02/0x89` pushes (~15 Hz): the painted box eases toward
each push with the core's constants (centre fast, size slow), a lock the body started
on its own screen becomes a box here, and 0.35 s without a push means the body let
go. `X` clears only when a box is out, and a push still in flight for 0.28 s after
the clear is ignored rather than resurrecting the box. Losing the link drops the box.
The box is drawn where it is on the sensor, so a mirrored picture shows it mirrored
too. Without pushes the poll decides: the box comes off at the first idle after a
lock, or after six idle answers with no lock. The AF-C
face bracket is not here: the phones detect faces on-device, and the desktop has no
detector yet.

Touch is handled explicitly rather than left to the system: once winit registers a window
for touch, Windows stops synthesising mouse clicks from taps, so without this a finger on
the picture would do nothing at all.

One finger owns the box. A second finger, or a palm steadying the laptop, is ignored
until the first lifts — but a finger that lands on a letterbox bar never claims the drag
it did not start, so it cannot lock out the next one that does land on the shot. A
cancelled touch — the system claiming the gesture, a palm rejected — abandons the box
rather than committing it: pointing the camera at whatever a finger happened to be over
is worse than not tracking at all.

The rule lives in `Shell::touch`, not in the window, so all of that is pinned by tests on
a machine with no touchscreen. What is **not** tested is whether the events arrive at all;
that needs a real touchscreen.

## Formats

`[` and `]` walk the body's **own** list of format pairs rather than a ladder this shell
invented. Resolution and frame rate are not independent — a body that shoots 4K may only
offer 24, 25 and 30 there while 1080p goes to 120 — so stepping resolution keeps the
frame rate when both shoot it and falls to that resolution's first when they do not. A
format the body did not list steps nowhere: guessing at a neighbour would change the shot
to something nobody asked for.

## How it is put together

```
opc-monitor (bin)
├── link.rs   the datalink on its own thread
├── phone.rs  (in the library) a phone's shared feed on its own thread, via opc-relay
├── view.rs   winit: events in, intents out
└── shell.rs  (in the library) every decision
```

`Shell` holds the whole operator-facing behaviour and has no window, no GPU and no camera
in it. Presses, drags and clock ticks go in; `Intent::Send`, `Intent::Still` and
`Intent::Quit` come out. That is what makes the viewfinder testable: 26 tests drive it
with a fake clock, and five more drive it together with the renderer on a software Vulkan
device, because chrome that is decided correctly and then never reaches the glass is a
failure neither side's own tests would catch.

`link.rs` is a thread because the datalink has a 40 Hz ACK pump to keep and a 5 ms read
timeout to sit on, and the window has a swapchain to feed. Neither can wait for the
other. Two channels, and nothing shared but the messages.

## Things that are decided here, not guessed

- **Tracking maps through the letterbox.** A drag is normalised against exactly the
  rectangle the blit drew into, and mirroring is undone before the box reaches the
  camera: the operator points at what they see, and the camera is told where that is on
  its own sensor. A drag smaller than 2% of a side is a click, and a click sends nothing —
  clearing what the camera is following by accident is worse than doing nothing.
- **A committed box stops being drawn after 1.5 seconds.** The camera does not report
  where the subject moved to, so a box left on screen would stop being where the subject
  is, and the operator would believe it.
- **The zoom follows the body.** Somebody may have turned the ring; the next `+` steps
  to the stop above where the lens actually is. Which stops the body has is the core's
  answer (`CameraModel.activeZoomStops`), asked again whenever the model, format or
  shooting mode moves.
- **Every live-control SET goes through the phones' mailbox.** The core's
  `CameraSetMailbox` decides, per opcode, what may go on the wire: one generation at a
  time, latest wins (a wheel or a slider replaces its pending step rather than queuing),
  the zoom slider pipelined at 20 Hz. The datalink keeps its clock the way the phones
  do — retransmit once after 300 ms of silence, settle at 2 s, accept a late ACK for
  the open generation, drop a superseded one. A FORMAT just sent is pinned on its chip
  until the body confirms it or the settle window passes; a SET nobody answered puts
  "no answer from the camera" in the top bar.
- **Presented frames drive the watchdog**, not arrived ones. A decoder quietly producing
  nothing looks exactly like a healthy feed otherwise — the black-picture-with-live-HUD
  failure this whole port has been written around.
- **A backlog skips to a keyframe**, never drops predicted pictures. Only the first coded
  slice of an access unit is read to decide that; the parameter sets ahead of it say
  nothing about whether it refreshes.

## What has not been run

No camera, and no window. `link.rs` and `view.rs` reach the Swift core, so
