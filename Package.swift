import PackageDescription

// The portable, UI-free, I/O-free core for OpenPocketCine: DUML framing, UDP datalink
// byte math, BLE advert decode, command builders, status decode, and saved-camera
// records. Pure Foundation, so it builds and tests natively on macOS (`swift test`)
// without a device. The iOS app (ios/) imports this and supplies CoreBluetooth /
// Network / Hotspot I/O. Android consumes the same target via a JNI facade
// (`just android-core`) — keep this module UI-free and platform-agnostic.
